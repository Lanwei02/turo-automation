# turo-automation

The script (scrape.py) runs Selenium on top of Chrome's WebDriver to log in to your account, scrapes your trip receipts, and dumps the result into a CSV file.

To get started you should install everything in requirements.txt and download the latest [Chrome WebDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads). After that just make the appropiate changes to SAMPLE_config.py and save it as config.py.
